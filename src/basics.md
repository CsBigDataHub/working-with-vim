# Basics

Here are a few editor basics, things you do in every editor.


## Copy-Paste-Delete

First up, the most common actions are `y` for yank (copy), `d` for delete, and `p` for put (paste).

### Copy / Delete Lines

Deleting a full line is so common, the `dd` shortcut exists.

If you delete a line and want to paste it elsewhere, use `p` to paste.

Likewise, you can copy a line using `yy` shortcut.

### Delete to End of Line

Did you know `D` deletes from your cursor to end of line? It does. Try it. It's wonderful. I use this all the time.

You have to type `d^` to do the opposite and delete to the front of the line, I almost never do this, probably why there is a shortcut for the previous delete and not this one.

### Undo / Redo

Use `u` for undo, and `ctrl-r` for redo.
