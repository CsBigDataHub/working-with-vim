# Working with Vim

A set of vim tips and features I use often, the goal is to help you improve your fluency with vim. I initially titled this post "Intermediate Vim" but experiences vary and non-linear, so what may be intermediate for some is basic or advanced for others.

A basic understanding of vim is a prerequisite, I try to explain everything but assume some base knowledge.  At minimum you should know moves (`h,j,k,l`), entering INSERT mode (`i,a`), or escaping to NORMAL mode (`esc`), and how to quit (`:q`).

The program `vimtutor` is a great way to learn the basics of vim. It is an interactive tutorial in vim walking through vim. Depending on your OS and how vim is installed, you may need to install the full vim package. Ubuntu for example ships with a tiny vim setup, you need to run `apt install vim`. If you use Neovim, run `:Tutor` inside the editor.

In the videos, the big yellow text in the bottom right are the key presses I do. They are overlayed using <a href="https://gitlab.com/wavexx/screenkey">screenkey</a> and not part of vim. I recorded videos so you can start/stop at will and see what is happening.

## Lessons

I recommend as you go through the lessons here, open vim in another window and follow along. You need try things out with your hands typing them as you go. It is like learning a language, repetition and practice helps.

Also, there is a lot to learn here. Don't try to cram it all in. Pick up an item at a time and slowly work in to your methodology.
