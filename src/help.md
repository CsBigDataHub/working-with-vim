# Help Yourself

Vim has extensive documentation on every command and feature. Type `:help [command]` to see help for any command. For example, `:help gg` will explain what the `gg` command does.

Help opens in a new window split horizontally, see Windows section below for working with windows. The two items I do most is `ctrl-w o` so it is the only window (not split), and `ctrl-w c` to close. Help is just a read-only buffer, so you can navigate, highlight, copy, paste, the same as any other buffer.
