# Help Yourself

Vim has extensive documentation on every command and feature. This is the first place to turn if you ever have a question.

Type `:help [command]` to see help for any command. For example, `:help gg` will explain what the `gg` command does.

Help opens in a new window split horizontally, see [Windows section](/working-with-vim/windows/) for working with windows.

You can close the window split using `ctrl-w c` or `:bd`

To make help the only window, use `ctrl-w o` this removes the split but does not close help. You then can close the help buffer using `:bd`.

Help is a read-only buffer. You can navigate, highlight, copy, paste, and do the same as any other buffer, except edit. See [Buffers section](/working-with-vim/buffers/) for more on working with buffers.
