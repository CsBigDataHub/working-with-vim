# Text Object Selection

<span class="sidenote">See `:help text-object`</span> Vim can operate on text based on its objects and structure. The inner object `i` is quite useful to select chunks of text inside parentheses, brackets, quotes, tags and other pairs, use `a` to also select the delimiters.

An example might help illustrate. To select text inside an html tag you can use the tag text object `t`. With your cursor between the tags, use `v` to enter visual mode, `i` for inner, `t` for tag. So `vit` will select interior content between two tags. Use `vat` to select content with tags.

## Selection Commands

Combine the text objects with operators. For example, to copy the arguments in a function use `yi(`

If you want delete a block of code in a `{ ... }` with your cursor inside the block, type `di{`

For text in quotes, type `yi"` to copy the word without the quotes. If you want copy to include the quotes use `a` instead of `i`.
